\caption{Vertical cross-sections ($x=0$ cm) through the pressure head and saturation fields from the numerical simulation at two times: (a) pressure head field at $t=5.2$ hours and (b) $t=10.3$ hours; and (c) saturation field at $t=5.2$ hours and (d) $t=10.3$ hours. The saturation field plots also show measurement locations and green highlighted regions that are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:richards-data}. The true location of the two soils used are shown with a dashed outline.}
